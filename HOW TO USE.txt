1. Make sure you have the required modules installed, PIL and python version 3.6 or above
2. Download the program file and save it on your local machine.
3. Create a folder called "graphics" in the same directory where you have saved the program file.
4. Place the overlay images you want to use in the "graphics" folder, and make sure to rename them to "overlay.png" and "overlay_black.png" for the black overlay.
5. Note that the overlay images should be 2500px by 2500px only. If the overlay images are of different size, it will mess up the positioning of the mockups.
6. If you want to use different overlays or positions and scales you can either change the values in the given examples or you can read the values from a CSV file or database
7. Run the program file by executing the following command on your command prompt or terminal
8. Copy code
9. python fileName.py
10. The program will now execute and add the overlay images to the tshirt images.
11. The resulting images will be saved as "modified_tshirt1.jpg, modified_tshirt2.jpg and modified_tshirt3.jpg" (in the same directory where the original images were stored)
12. Please note that, the above guide is a general instruction and may require some modification depending on the specific requirements of your use case.
13. Also, it is advisable to keep a backup of your original images and test the program on a few images first before running the program on the entire dataset.
